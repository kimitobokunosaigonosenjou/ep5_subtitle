1
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,830
Lady Aliceliese?!

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,370
What brings you to an outpost like this?!

3
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,790
I had some business to take care of nearby.

4
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,540
Please wait! This is off-limits...

5
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,990
It's the vortex.

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,290
Yes, there's no mistaking it.

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,790
I thought something was going on,
but it's you two.

8
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,700
Masked Lord, do you plan on monopolizing this?

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,660
You've got the wrong idea. This vortex
was found just moments ago.

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,450
We are about to report our findings
to Her Majesty right now.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,120
Oh, good timing.

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,490
Come here, Kissing.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,580
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

14
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,790
Come, Kissing. This is your relative, Alice.

15
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,330
You don't remember?

16
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,910
Well, I guess that can't be helped.
You were still little.

17
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,410
Anyway, Alice. You can leave
the defending of the Vortex to me.

18
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,790
You mean to say that she alone is enough
to go up against the Imperial army?

19
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,870
I believe her talent
could surpass that of your own.

20
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,290
I have no intention of casting doubt
on the Zoa's treasured child.

21
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,290
But what does the Zoa family plan on
doing with the power of this vortex?

22
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,580
Do you want an all-out war with the Empire?

23
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,910
But of course. Every astral mage
has been wishing that for 100 years.

24
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,660
Nene, what did you just say?

25
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,200
What do you mean, there are
astral power readings from the base?

26
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,990
HQ is analyzing it now,
but it's different from the vortex.

27
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,080
Could it be from an astral art?

28
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,330
This is Mismis from Unit N07.

29
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,790
What?! I understand.

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,910
They confirmed that the readings
from the base are from an astral art.

31
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,080
So the astral power forces
have infiltrated our base.

32
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,490
I bet the missing Imperial soldiers
were kidnapped by them.

33
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,410
What are our orders?

34
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,740
Right now, they're moving anything
of importance to the second base.

35
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,240
We're to continue our search for the vortex.

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,660
Got anything, Nene?

37
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,040
There's an astral power reading close by, but...

38
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,870
We'll just have to go over the place
with a fine-tooth comb.

39
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,490
Boss, lead the way.

40
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,330
A-All right...

41
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,370
Umm... That way!

42
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,490
Huh?

43
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,790
Astral light value is over 2,000 lunas!

44
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,160
Captain, nice work!

45
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,990
That light must be the vortex!

46
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,620
Huh?! So we're the first to find it?!

47
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,200
Maybe HQ will give us recognition!

48
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,490
Hate to break it to you, but it looks like
we're not the first ones here.

49
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,620
Oh, it's Noro's unit.

50
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,990
Mismis, did you see that light
from the vortex just now?

51
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,540
Of course!

52
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,240
That's too bad.

53
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,120
Huh?

54
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,870
Way before you guys spotted it,

55
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,330
the Sovereignty already had a trap
set up at the bottom of that valley.

56
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,410
Our plan was to capture
Imperial troops heading this way.

57
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,330
Just like this.

58
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,370
Captain!

59
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,290
Don't move, Imperial soldiers!

60
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,540
Sh-She's a witch!

61
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,410
That's right. I'm what you call a witch.

62
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,450
Along with everyone else on my team.

63
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,950
Noro, why? What did you do with the real Noro?

64
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,950
You still haven't figured it out?
You really are a dum-dum.

65
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,990
But that's what I love about you.

66
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,830
Shanorotte Gregory was born and raised
in the Nebulis Sovereignty.

67
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,580
Ever since I met you,
I am the one and only Shanorotte.

68
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,240
Out of my way.

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,790
Fifth Division Unit O04.
You'll be prosecuted here and now.

70
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,990
Scum witches sneaking into the Empire.
I told you to stay out of my way.

71
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,660
Nameless...

72
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,160
Did you really think I wouldn't
notice a traitor amongst us?

73
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,990
That's right. Sir Saint Disciple
is from the Assassination Force.

74
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,240
But it wouldn't do us any good
if I got captured here.

75
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,990
You will be prosecuted.

76
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,410
Jhin!

77
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,660
I got it!

78
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,290
Boy, have you lost your mind?

79
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,740
That knife... Were you going to pierce
Shanorotte along with our captain?

80
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,870
Insubordination against a commander.
Do you wish to go back to prison?

81
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,580
Mr. Saint Disciple, right now,
we should be tracking them.

82
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,830
We know where they're going.

83
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,410
Our mission remains the same.

84
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,410
If the vortex has fallen
into the enemy's hands...

85
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,660
Are you serious?

86
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,200
Once I return to the base,
we will bomb the whole enemy base.

87
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,410
They'll be annihilated, and that's it.

88
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,540
It seems it's unexpectedly small.

89
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,080
With the vortex this small,

90
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,200
only a few astral mages would reap
the benefits, even if they jump in.

91
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,700
Yes, maybe one or two could
grow stronger, but that'd be it.

92
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,410
After that, the astral energy will be spent.

93
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,410
My Lord, comrade Shanorotte has returned.

94
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,910
Hello, comrade Shanorotte.

95
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,330
Good job on capturing an Imperial soldier.

96
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,240
Thank you.

97
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,620
Huh?

98
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,990
What?

99
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,160
This is bad... No one knows about my
meetings with Iska in the Neutral city!

100
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
Uh... I've seen you before...

101
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,540
Y-You must be mistaken!

102
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,700
Oh, I know! I remember! You're A--

103
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,580
You're careless to bring an enemy soldier
into our HQ, even if she is restrained.

104
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,990
Yes, I'm so sorry!

105
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,950
Rin, thank you.

106
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,330
Of course. But with the female captain
and the Imperial soldier,

107
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,040
I just cannot believe how many
times they've stood in our way.

108
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
This is it! Jackpot!

109
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
What?

110
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,620
Comrade Shanorotte, leave everything to me!

111
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,740
You have the location to
the Imperial army's camp, right?

112
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,790
Lady Alice, what exactly are you...

113
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,290
This is my one chance in a million! This is
my opportunity to fight Iska again!

114
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,160
What?! L-Lady Alice, have you lost your mind?!

115
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,370
My mind is sound.

116
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm coming for you, Iska!

117
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,040
Intersection:
Awakening of the Vortex

118
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,490
Footprints?

119
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,790
The tracker is right where
the vortex is located at.

120
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,910
Boss and the others must be held there.

121
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,540
We only have two more hours
until they launch a missile.

122
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:02,810
What?!

123
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,660
That was a short-distance missile
from our base!

124
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,740
That was a lot faster than expected.

125
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,290
When's the next one?!

126
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,700
In 30... Maybe 20 minutes.

127
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,410
Based on the ballistics data they just got,
their accuracy will improve.

128
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,740
We don't have much time. Let's go.

129
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,370
Do not panic! We knew the Empire
would be bombing us!

130
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,290
Everyone, retreat to the second base!

131
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,080
Noro, please stop...

132
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Don't look at me with those eyes.

133
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,160
It makes me want to pull harder.

134
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,540
I'm here to take back our captain.

135
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,660
You're one of Mismis' subordinates!

136
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,080
My lightning! How dare you, Imperial soldier!

137
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,790
Impossible!

138
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,240
Th...

139
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,160
Th...

140
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,910
Thorns...

141
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,080
...hurt...

142
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,700
Lady Kissing! Have you come to help me?!

143
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,950
Thorns...

144
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,740
Eliminate...

145
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,700
What?!

146
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,330
Elimination complete...

147
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,870
Uncle... One... mission... complete...

148
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,080
Lady Kissing, you're incredible!
You indeed carry the Founder's blood!

149
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,700
Imperial soldiers... Eliminate...

150
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,950
Those are my orders...

151
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,910
Captain, please stay back.

152
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,490
Iska?!

153
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,830
She's a purebred, and a strong one.

154
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,330
Looks like no one's home.

155
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,990
Lady Alice!

156
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,580
Rin!

157
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,490
Hm, good instinct.

158
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,490
Emperor's direct report, Saint Disciple!

159
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,870
Your optical camouflage suit...
I've heard about you. Nameless, isn't it?

160
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,240
Must be intel from Shanorotte.

161
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,990
Nice to meet you. Not to be abrupt,
but I'm extremely upset.

162
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,450
About?

163
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,120
About you hurting Rin.

164
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,450
And also the bad luck causing me and
a particular someone to miss each other.

165
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,080
So I hope it's all right
to take my anger out on you!

166
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,370
He avoided... my attack...?

167
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,740
Become a star...

168
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,830
Indiscriminate attack?!

169
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,240
U-U-Unexpected...

170
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,830
Strong opponent... Saint Disciple...

171
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,950
Liberate my ability... Recombination...

172
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,370
She can regenerate objects?!

173
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,240
Imperial soldier... Disappear...

174
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,330
Ice Calamity: Thousand Thorn Blizzard.

175
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,660
Pierce through!

176
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,330
So slow.

177
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,490
This can't be...

178
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,160
Let me return the favor.

179
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,240
Apologies for overstepping.

180
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,870
No, Rin. Thank you.

181
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,370
Where did your earlier bravado go?

182
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,990
I apologize for being rude, Saint Disciple
of the eighth seat, Nameless.

183
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,660
I had doubts about your strength.

184
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,040
Allow me to express my sincerest apology.

185
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,790
I will show you my true power.

186
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,830
Great Ice Calamity.

187
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,200
He got away.

188
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,990
Let's go back. This was a waste.

189
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,410
It's from the vortex's direction!

190
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,620
Elimination... complete...

191
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,330
Who did you eliminate?

192
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,790
Iska!

193
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,290
How did he escape that explosion...?!

194
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,410
Black... slices through astral art...

195
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,410
White... resurrects it...?

196
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,950
Counterattack...

197
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:30,040
Never mind that. Who taught you such
a self-destructive way of fighting?

198
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,160
Liberate... Dragon of Thorns.

199
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,120
You are a formidable opponent.

200
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,620
But that doesn't mean you can easily win
every time with your ability.

201
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,490
Iska! I'm glad you're okay!

202
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,200
I knew you'd come save me.

203
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,040
Let's retreat. I'll carry this purebred back--

204
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,490
That won't do.

205
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,240
Twisting your body at the last minute?

206
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,160
Such amazing reaction speed and body control.

207
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,950
Who are you?

208
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,740
You should worry about
your captain instead of me.

209
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,370
Now, if you'll excuse me.

210
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,910
Let us meet again, Imperial soldier
whose name I do not know.

211
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,830
Captain!

212
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,990
Captain!

213
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,330
Iska!

214
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,910
Captain!

215
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,660
Iska!

216
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,870
Answer me!

217
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,200
Alice!

218
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,660
Where were you this whole time?!

219
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Huh?

220
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,950
I went all the way to the Empire's camp,
but you weren't there!

221
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,950
It's all because that fortune teller
said you'd be close by!

222
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,370
Fortune teller?

223
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,370
N-Never mind that!

224
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,490
Grab my hand! Quickly!

225
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,660
Um...

226
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,990
I'll help you under one condition.

227
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,410
You'll fight me as soon as we're back on ground.

228
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,620
That's why I went looking for you!

229
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,370
If that's your condition, I'm game.

230
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm holding you to it.

231
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,370
Spirals, shine the way!

232
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,370
So e lu emnue xel noi es.

233
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,240
How could this be?!
The astral energy is growing too fast!

234
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,160
Lady Alice!

235
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,200
Are you all right?!

236
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,950
I can't believe an astral spirit
got in our way! Such bad timing!

237
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,740
Huh?

238
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,830
Just when I finally got to see him again.

239
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,120
You better stay alive until we fight again...

240
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,990
Iska! Captain Mismis!

241
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,700
Iska, you good?

242
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,330
Yeah... Just barely.
We both fell into the vortex.

243
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,910
What?! How did you survive that?!

244
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,160
I owe her one.
